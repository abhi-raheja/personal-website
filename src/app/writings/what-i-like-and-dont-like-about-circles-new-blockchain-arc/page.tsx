                I read the Arc litepaper so you don't have to.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                When my friend Sanket_Jain_ and his cracked team joined circle a few months back, I knew something new was coming.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Well, now Arc is here and here's what stands out for me in this launch ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                First of all, yes you heard that right: Arc is circle's new Layer-1 blockchain, that is focused on building *regulated* financial apps & services with stablecoins. w/ Arc, they want to combine the programmability of smart contracts and the enforceability of law (GENIUS Act).
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                I'm going to skip the part about whether this could be an L2 and that entire discussion. There are plenty of brilliant speculators on CT who can do a better job at that than me. However, I do find some really *interesting* design choices that I think are worth talking about.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                But before we talk about design and feature set, it's worth wondering why a blockchain in the first place?
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base">
                <li>If the 'yield on T-bills' biz model was as good as it seemed as per the public markets, and the Coinbase deal was working as intended, this just seems changing course, no?</li>
                <li>is this the end of the fat protocol era? are we back to distribution is king? If yes, what happens to the base x circle deal?</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-base">
                btw no hate on changing course, in fact I respect biz leaders who are pragmatic. But if arc is now going to build a blockchain ecosystem, I would love to see more open comms on ecosystem decisions to build trust with builders.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Anywho - let's get back to what's underneath Arc:
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Acc. to the litepaper, Arc's three pillars are:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base">
                <li>Deterministic, sub-second finality with a *permissioned* consensus engine.</li>
                <li>Opt-in privacy for compliance and auditor-friendliness.</li>
                <li>Stablecoins (USDC and others via paymaster in the future) as network gas currency for predictable costs for enterprises</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-base">
                Initial design highlights:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-base">
                <li>Permissioned Tendermint BFT w/ &lt;1s finality</li>
                <li>USDC for gas + paymaster for other stables</li>
                <li>FX primitives (matching engine + RFQ)</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-base">
                Later releases:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-base">
                <li>Privacy initially via TEEs but modular</li>
                <li>Encrypted mempool</li>
                <li>Multiple concurrent proposers</li>
                <li>PoA -&gt; PoS</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-base">
                ok so, first - I find it fascinating that Arc is going to be *openly* permissioned.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                It will be run by a set of known institutions.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                fwiw, i think this is the pragmatic approach. The "next trillion dollars" will only come onchain when institutions can see accountability, directly
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Arc claims to achieve sub-second finality with *Malachite.*
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Malachite is a Rust-based, high-performance consensus engine achieving sub-second finality by finalizing blocks in milliseconds.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                It basically implements the Tendermint BFT protocol and Arc saw:
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                ~ 3,000 TPS with
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-8 mb-4">On Privacy:</h2>

              <p className="text-base">
                Don't forget, Sanket_Jain_'s Gateway_xyz was building in MPC. So it was a no brainer that there was going to be a privacy angle with USDC.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                I am pleasantly surprised about Arc in this matter:
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Arc will offer *opt-in* privacy features with an overall focus on
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Other privacy features being considered:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-base">
                <li>encrypted mempools</li>
                <li>privacy-preserving ai treasury management</li>
                <li>dark pools (w/ private order books?)</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-base">
                Note, arc specifically points out their backend is designed in a way so as to be easily compatible with other tech like FHE, MPC and
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-8 mb-4">On Native Assets:</h2>

              <p className="text-base">
                While native support for USDC, EURC, and USYC was a no-brainer, I found it interesting that Arc wants to allow "other issuers of tokenized money - from fiat-backed stablecoins, to tokenized bank deposits and central bank money."
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                This ^ along with the
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                Other very interesting features/things:
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                FX engine: pvp fx settlement between vetted counterparties.<br/>
                Offchain Request-for-Quote (RFQ) execution layer (permissioned).<br/>
                Invoicing metadata for Txs(!)<br/>
                Refund and dispute payments(!)
              </p>

              <p className="text-base">
                all very impressive.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black mt-8 mb-4">My take:</h2>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-base">
                <li>I find the overall deliverable here close to what you'd expect from a team like Circle. It doesn't WOW me, but it's competitive and pragmatic.</li>
                <li>Circle has done tons for our industry (to their own advantage also ofc!) but I think on a spectrum of private to public</li>
