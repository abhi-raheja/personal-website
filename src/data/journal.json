    "content": "ever wonder why pink himalayan salt is pink? turns out, pink himalayan salt comes from a singular salt mine in Pakistan (formed millions of years ago after ancient seabeds dried up) and over time many minerals, notably iron oxide, seeped into the salt crystals. It is iron oxide that gives this salt a pink/rosy hint - bascially rust! Also turns out, that pink himalayan salt is actually no more healthier than regular salt. It's all marketing!"

    "content": "allow yourself to take a U-turn on things you once wanted, opinions you held strongly, career decisions you could have traded anything for, and feelings that once ruled your world. There's no playbook to life, stop living someone else's construction of how we ought to live. It's okay to spend many years going after something, whether it's a job, a person, a skill, or a place, and then once you get there, you realize that it's not for you. It doesn't matter what others might think of your decision to turn around and go in a different direction. Life is not linear. Life is too short to stick to one thing."

    "content": "why are humans always altering their mind/consciousness? Whether it's a coffee and a cigarette in the morning to alcohol and cocaine in the night, it feels like a lot of us are - in some way or another - constantly trying to change their perceived sense of reality. Hell - sometimes I think even a huge cup of icecream sends me to space. I personally know at least half a dozen people in my immediate vicinity that go on astral journeys via psychedelics almost every weekend, and are comfortable doing that for days at a time.  Given we don't know pretty much anything about consciousness, it feels conterintuitive to conduct such experiments. But, is that really so?"
