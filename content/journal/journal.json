    "content": "why are humans always altering their mind/consciousness? Whether it's a coffee and a cigarette in the morning to alcohol and cocaine in the night, it feels like a lot of us are - in some way or another - constantly trying to change their perceived sense of reality. Hell - sometimes I think even a huge cup of icecream sends me to space. I personally know at least half a dozen people in my immediate vicinity that go on astral journeys via psychedelics almost every weekend, and are comfortable doing that for days at a time.  Given we don't know pretty much anything about consciousness, it feels conterintuitive to conduct such experiments. But, is that really so?"
