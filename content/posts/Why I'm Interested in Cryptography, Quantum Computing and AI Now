I’ve gotten a few DMs asking why my feed now veers into cryptography, quantum, and AI. From the outside it might look like a sudden pivot. To me, it’s continuity.

I’ve always followed my curiosity. As a small-town kid in India, I was absorbed by social, political, and economic history—thanks to patient teachers at OP Jindal Modern School. One lesson stuck: winners write the story. That tension—truth vs narrative—pulled me toward storytelling, media, and writing, and eventually to Ryerson’s School of Journalism, where I learned from people like Stuart Coxe, Shenaz, Sonya Fateh, Kathleen Goldhar, and Lisa Gabriele.

Student politics in India and Canada taught me that entrepreneurship is a practical lever for durable, measurable impact. Technology was the obvious substrate. Partnering with Muhammad Lila to build Goodable sharpened that instinct: use media + technology to tilt outcomes positive.

Ethereum and blockchains felt like the convergence: history, economics, markets, social change, technology, and media stitched together. Building with teams at Cyber and Caldera forced me to think hard about incentive design, game theory, markets, surveillance, and anti-authoritarian tech. It also gave me the gift of learning across cultures—with Ryan Li, whom I consider a generational founder.

I’m a child of the internet; I watched it quietly reorganize reality. That vantage point—plus detours through media, history, entrepreneurship, and markets—shapes my thesis about the next few decades: the post–New Deal arc of social and economic change will look small relative to what’s coming. We’re entering an era of evolutionary acceleration, beginning with an intelligence boom on track for the late 2020s—likely before 2028. If that lands, it will compress progress in both bits (markets, education, governance, the internet) and atoms (space, physics, chemistry, genomics, biotech).

Quantum computing is a potential force-multiplier—a destabilizing boost that could rewire assumptions across cryptography, optimization, and scientific discovery.

So no, this isn’t a detour. AI, quantum computing, and cryptography sit squarely at the intersection of my long-standing curiosities and my work. I feel lucky to explore them. When it’s time to chase the next frontier, you’ll see it here first.

For now, I’m enjoying writing about these systems, the incentives that shape them, and the societal outcomes they’ll drive.
