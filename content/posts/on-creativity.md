Creativity isn't magic. It's not some mystical force that strikes randomly, leaving us helpless to control when inspiration hits. This romantic notion of the tortured artist waiting for divine intervention is not only misleading—it's counterproductive.

The most creative people I know treat creativity like a craft. They show up every day, whether they feel inspired or not. They understand that creativity is a muscle that grows stronger with use, not a finite resource that depletes.

## The Myth of Inspiration

We've been sold a story about creativity that goes something like this: sit around, wait for inspiration to strike, then frantically capture the lightning in a bottle before it disappears. This approach might work occasionally, but it's hardly a reliable way to produce meaningful work.

The truth is that inspiration often comes during the work, not before it. When you sit down to write, draw, code, or create in any form, the act of creating itself generates new ideas. Motion creates motion.

## Small Consistent Steps

I've found that committing to small, consistent actions yields better results than sporadic bursts of intensive work. Writing 200 words daily will produce more—and better—writing than waiting for the perfect moment to write 2,000 words.

This isn't just about quantity. Consistent practice allows your subconscious to work on problems in the background. Solutions often appear not when you're actively struggling with them, but during the quiet moments in between sessions.

## The Compound Effect

Daily practice creates a compound effect. Each session builds on the previous one. Skills develop incrementally, ideas connect across time, and eventually, what seemed impossible becomes second nature.

The key is to start small enough that you can't fail. Make the barrier to entry so low that even on your worst days, you can still show up. Consistency beats intensity every time.

## Creating Conditions for Creativity

Rather than waiting for creativity to happen to you, create conditions where it's more likely to emerge:

- **Establish routines** that signal to your brain it's time to create
- **Eliminate friction** by having your tools ready and accessible
- **Protect your creative time** like you would any important appointment
- **Embrace imperfection** and give yourself permission to create badly

The goal isn't to produce masterpieces every day. It's to show up consistently and trust that the accumulation of small efforts will lead to something meaningful.

Creativity flourishes in the mundane, in the daily choice to sit down and do the work regardless of how you feel. Make that choice, and watch what unfolds.
