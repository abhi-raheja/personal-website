# Personal Website Project

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a new personal website that will serve as both a portfolio/resume and a platform for their writings. Key requirements:

- **User Profile**: Non-technical user
- **Design**: Minimalist yet artistic
- **Technology**: Next.js for nice effects and fonts
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Content**: About section + writings (no categorization needed)
- **Navigation**: Very simple
- **Contact**: No contact form needed
- **Future Feature**: Email subscription for new posts

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **GitHub Pages + Next.js**: GitHub Pages has limitations with Next.js server-side features, so we need static export configuration
2. **Non-technical maintenance**: Must be extremely easy to add new posts and content
3. **Design inspiration**: satviksethi.com shows clean typography, subtle animations, minimal navigation
4. **Future email subscriptions**: Need to plan architecture that allows easy integration of email services later

## Lessons

- User prefers spinning up local server for testing before committing to GitHub
- Always evaluate feedback and get explicit approval before moving to next phase
- Include debugging info in program output
- Read files before editing them
- Run npm audit if vulnerabilities appear
- Ask before using force git commands
- Write tests first, then code, then run tests until they pass
