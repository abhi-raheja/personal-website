# This is a placeholder for the social media preview image
# You'll need to create an actual 1200x630px image and replace this file
# 
# Recommended design:
# - Clean, professional layout
# - Your name "Abhi Raheja" prominently displayed
# - Tagline: "COO at Sunscreen. Former journalist, founder and operator."
# - Subtle background or pattern
# - High contrast text for readability
# 
# Tools you can use:
# - Canva (templates available)
# - Figma
# - Adobe Creative Suite
# - Online generators like og-image.vercel.app
#
# For now, this placeholder will cause the social preview to fall back to default behavior
